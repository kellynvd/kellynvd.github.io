<h3> Hello world! I'm Kellyn!</h3>

My full name is Kellyn Vianna Duarte, I'm 28 years old, I graduated in pegagogy but I decided to be a software developer, I'm vegan 🥑 and passionate about education, technology and personal development. ❤️

One of the best ways to stay motivated is to connect with people with the same passion, so this will be a place to share all my experiences and thoughts with you and to encourage other women to learn how to program as well - but everyone can benefit from knowledge.

I hope you join me on this journey! We Can Do It! 💪

If you want to talk, just send an email to <strong> kellynvd@gmail.com </strong> or give me an 'Hello' on <a class="aboutLinks" href="https://www.instagram.com/kellynvd" target="_blank"><strong>instagram </strong></a>.
